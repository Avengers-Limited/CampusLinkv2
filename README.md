## 🎨 Design System

CampusLink follows a modern, clean design language:

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: `#6C63FF` (Purple) - Main brand color
- **Secondary**: `#FF6584` (Pink) - Accent color
- **Background**: `#FFFFFF` / `#F8F9FA`
- **Text**: `#1A1A1A` / `#666666` / `#999999`

All colors are defined in `constants/colors.js` for easy customization.

## 🔒 Security

- All passwords are securely hashed by Supabase Auth
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies protect user data
- API keys are safe to use in the client (anon key is public)
- Never commit sensitive credentials to version control

## 📝 Database Schema

### Main Tables

1. **profiles**
   - User profile information
   - Linked to Supabase Auth users
   - Stores: name, bio, major, year, skills, etc.

2. **posts**
   - Social feed posts
   - User-generated content
   - Categories and interactions

3. **teams**
   - Team/project information
   - Creator, description, category
   - Open positions tracking

4. **team_members**
   - Junction table for team membership
   - User-team relationships
   - Role management

## 🧪 Testing

# Run tests (to be implemented)

```
